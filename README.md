# When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games-
Use joins and set theory to discover the best years for video games!

Project Description:

In this project, we will analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. We will search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and we will explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data. Our search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. We will also filter, group, and order data.


Project Tasks:

1. The ten best-selling video games
2. Missing review scores
3. Years that video game critics loved
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Years that dropped off the critics' favourites list
6. Years video game players loved
7. Years that both players and critics loved
8. Sales in the best video game years
